# Architecture

This document describes how Agenthesia is built. Decisions and their rationale live in
[ADRs](adr/); this is the map.

## Repository layout

```
agenthesia/
├── App/                        # App target: @main, assets, Info.plist, entitlements
├── Agenthesia.xcodeproj        # Thin: one app target + the local package
├── Packages/AgenthesiaKit/     # All logic and UI, as a Swift package
│   ├── Sources/<Module>/
│   ├── Tests/<Module>Tests/
│   └── Resources/acp-schema/   # Pinned ACP schema (reference + conformance tests)
└── docs/                       # Vision, architecture, ADRs
```

The Xcode project only exists for what SwiftPM cannot do: the app bundle, signing, entitlements and
assets. Everything else is in `AgenthesiaKit`, which builds and tests with plain `swift build` /
`swift test`.

## Modules

Listed bottom-up. A module may only depend on modules above it in this list.

| Module | Responsibility | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `JSONRPC` | JSON-RPC 2.0 over newline-delimited streams. `Connection` actor: request/response correlation, dispatch of incoming requests and notifications, `$/cancel_request`, `-32601` for unknown methods. Knows nothing about ACP. | — |
| `ACP` | Hand-written `Codable` wire types in a versioned namespace (`ACP.V1`), typed client API, delegate for agent→client requests. The version-agnostic `AgentConnection` protocol and the v1 adapter that implements it. | `JSONRPC` |
| `AgentRuntime` | Login-shell environment resolution, agent process lifecycle, ACP Registry client, installers (binary, npm), managed Node runtime. | `ACP` |
| `Workspace` | Git (CLI wrapper), worktrees, PTYs, `TerminalHost` (ACP `terminal/*`, including long-lived background processes), file index for Quick Open, FSEvents watcher. | — |
| `Persistence` | SQLite via GRDB: projects, agent installs, sessions and the append-only event log. | — |
| `Rendering` | Text rendering shared by the transcript, diffs and the file viewer: tree-sitter highlighting, incremental Markdown, `SourceView` (TextKit 2), `DiffView`. | — |
| `AgenthesiaCore` | Domain: sessions, transcript reducer, permission queue, fs path policy, session manager, worktree lifecycle. | all of the above except `Rendering` |
| `AgenthesiaUI` | SwiftUI and AppKit views. | `AgenthesiaCore`, `Rendering` |
| `acp-cli` | Headless debug driver: talk to any ACP agent from a terminal. | `ACP`, `AgentRuntime` |
| `MockAgent` | Scriptable ACP agent driven by JSON fixtures, for tests. | `ACP` |

                                                                              │
                                                                              ▼
                                                                     AgenthesiaUI views
```

- One agent process per session ([ADR-0004](adr/0004-agent-runtime.md)).
- The event log is the source of truth for what is displayed; raw ACP updates are stored so old
  sessions can be re-rendered when the renderer improves ([ADR-0005](adr/0005-event-log.md)).
- Streaming chunks are coalesced once per frame before they reach the UI.

## Concurrency

- Swift 6 language mode with complete strict concurrency checking.
- I/O lives in actors (`JSONRPC.Connection`, process and PTY wrappers).
- Everything the UI observes is `@MainActor @Observable`. Actors publish to it through `AsyncStream`s.
- No `@unchecked Sendable` without a comment explaining why it is safe.

## Protocol version strategy

Only ACP v1 is implemented. v2 is an unstable draft that drops client-side `fs/*`, `terminal/*`,
`session/load`, modes and `authenticate`. Core therefore talks to a version-agnostic `AgentConnection`
built on the methods v1 and v2 share. Everything v1-only is contained in the v1 adapter
([ADR-0003](adr/0003-own-acp-implementation.md)).

## Dependencies

All third-party code must be under a GPLv3-compatible license. GPLv2-only and proprietary libraries are
not allowed (Apple system frameworks are fine).

Dependencies are added when the milestone that needs them starts, not up front.
